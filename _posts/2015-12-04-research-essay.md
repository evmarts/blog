title: A paper on social media marketing
---

In the second year of my undergrad I was tasked with writing a research paper for an English course. I was just starting to get into internet marketing so I chose to write a paper on social media marketing (SMM). Below is the opening paragraph from the research proposal I wrote:

In addition to already established companies, those wishing to start a business will look towards social media in order to collect a base of potential customers.

In this essay, I  explore the current state of marketing on social media sites and attempt to predict how social media marketing (SMM) will change the field of marketing.
