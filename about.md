### The Blog

This is a blog for my personal projects. I enjoy automating things so most of what you see will be about automating some process that would be tedious to do by hand.

Right now I'm pretty interested in social media marketing so I might have some posts about that as well. 
 
I also plan to post summaries or visualizations of the topic discussed in a paper I have found interesting. 

The code for these projects can be found on my Github page. 

### The Blogger

I am a Fourth-year student in the Computer Science and Statistics program at UBC, Vancouver. 

I have interests in machine learning, statistics and social media marketing.
